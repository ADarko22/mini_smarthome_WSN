# mini_smarthome_WSN
This is my implementation of the NES 2016-2017 Computer Engineering course from Univerisity of Pisa.

W.r.t. project specification I've added:

1.a) ACK Mechanism when BROACASTING the ALARM SWITCH:
      When ACTIVATING the ALARM if Node1 && Node2 Acks
      GREEN LED is TURNED ON otherwise RED LED is TURNED ON.
      When RED LED is ON could be an ERROR on ALARM ACTIVATION!
      
3.a) ALARM INPUT BLOCK Mechanism:
      When WAITING GATE and DOOR OPENING-CLOSING is not allowed to give ACTIVATE ALARM command.
      BLINKING the BLUE LED every 2s for 16s!
